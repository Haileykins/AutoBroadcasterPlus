# AutoBroadcasterPlus

### About AutoBroadcasterPlus
AutoBroadcasterPlus is sortof a fork of [AutoBroadcast GitHub](https://github.com/SkulMC/AutoBroadcaster) you can also 
find their plugin page here [AutoBroadcast SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/autobroadcaster.49662/). The only thing 
that would make me say it is not a fork is that I didn't fork the code, I (with permission) borrowed code from his 
plugin, and the root idea, then created a brand new Maven project, with more features, better tools and organization, 
and updating it to Maven Build will be great for any future devs who want to add their ideas!
